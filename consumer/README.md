## Salesforce setup
All steps are for old theme.

1. Create campaign
- Select `Campaigns` from main menu 
- click `New` 
- Enter any name 
- click `Save`  
- copy Campaign Id from URL
- Use this id and update `local/aws-cli/data/json`, replace `dripcampaignid`

2. OAuth app
- click on `Setup` from the top menu
- Select `Build -> Create -> Apps` from left menu
- Click `New` under `Connected Apps`
- Enter any name and email
- Select `Enable OAuth Settings` and enter the same settings as below

You can use the existing cert.pem from `config` directory.  
Or generate a new certificate and key using a command:  
`openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`

**Private key of your certificate is read from environment variable, instead of reading from the config directory. So please make sure you replace all new line characters with `\n` before setting it in the environment variable. Application would add newline characters back to the key when using it to sign the requests.**

Click Save  
![Alt text](https://monosnap.com/file/DHTJxilXzHrbXjz6HMfVSm8lMzUhkW.png)
`Consumer Key` is your Salesforce client Id

- Construct  URL `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[clientId]&redirect_uri=https://login.salesforce.com&response_type=code`
- replace `[clientId]` with your client id and open in your browser
- you must grant access to the current user, this operation must be done only once

3. Add a custom field to Lead
- click on `Setup` from the top menu
- Select `Build -> customize -> Leads -> Fields` from left menu
- Click `New` under `Lead Custom Fields & Relationships`
- Select `Text` DataType and click Next
- Set `Field Label` and `Field Name` to `Connect_Project_Id`
- Set `Length` to `20`
- Check `Unique`

- Click Next in all other steps

## Mock services
- Use docker compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ (use version 1.8)
```
cd local
docker-compose up --build
```

Set `dockerhost` in hosts file to your docker machine ip.  
You can check docker-machine by running ` docker-machine ip default`  
For linux use `localhost`  

Set `aws.endpoint` to `http://dockerhost:7777`  
Set `identityService.url` to `http://dockerhost:3001`  
Your aws region, key id and secret must match settings from `config` and `credentials` in `local/aws-cli/` directory

## Starting

Install dependencies:  
`npm install`


Prod mode:  
`npm start`

It's recommenced to use tools like forever or pm2.  
App will exit if there is any connection error to RabbitMQ.  

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever  
Example: 
```
forever start -c "npm start" --uid "consumer"  .
```

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2  
Example: 
```
pm2 start npm  --name consumer -- start
```
it will run a command `npm start` and set name to process `consumer`


Dev/local mode (auto reload + debug):  
`npm run dev`

Unit tests:   
`npm run test`

Run lint:   
`npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix` 

coverage:   
`npm run coverage`  
Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

## Windows issue
Coverage report doesn't work on Windows.


## Verification

Use following JSON for testing

### Project Create
```
{
    "id": 1,
    "status": "draft",
    "details": {
        "utm": {
            "code": "123"
        }
    },
    "directProjectId": 5001,
    "cancelReason":null,
    "members": [
        {
            "userId": 40135978,
            "role": "customer",
            "isPrimary": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Project Update
```
{
    "original" : {
        "id": 1,
        "status": "in_review"
    },
    "updated": {
        "id": 1,
        "status": "active",
        "directProjectId": 6001,
        "cancelReason": "Spam",
        "details": {
            "utm": {
                "code": "123"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can use a complete JSON, but other properties are not used.  

Open RabbitMQ Management Interface  
(in cloudamqp.com click on -> Control Panel -> Details -> RabbitMQ Management Interface)  
Open queues
![Alt text](https://monosnap.com/file/AKxR0CWNygSglchYOxpnW9fZ34WVnp.png)
Queues should be automatically created  
Open `created` queue and publish a new message
![Alt text](https://monosnap.com/file/fG2XsWpMj3jBMa0AqikyV66TAWxsDr.png) 

Go to Salesforce and select Lead from the top menu  
![Alt text](https://monosnap.com/file/W3abeQkgGMb4Z3Gc4Ncf7VLUhKscrH.png)
This is the new created lead  

Click on it to see details
![Alt text](https://monosnap.com/file/nHJtilGYA7jYNiMJNiXH5IERrrAePN.png)
Lead is associated to the campaign

Go to Rabbitmq and add the same message to the `launched` queue

Check the Lead details in Saleforce
![Alt text](https://monosnap.com/file/PdMF97k18cBGeZjR9qOkkBe1AjYw2n.png)
Lead is removed from the campaign

## Deployment Checklist
1. AppXpressConfig table exists in dynamodb with dripcampaignId
2. Make sure configured rabbitmq exchange and queue are created appropriately in cloumamqp
3. There should be proper mapping between exchange and queue specified in the conifguration
4. Grant permission, with user conifgured, for the app once using url https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[clientId]&redirect_uri=https://login.salesforce.com&response_type=code

## CI
* All changes into dev will be built and deployed to AWS beanstalk environment `tc-connect2sf-dev`
* All changes into master will be built and deployed to AWS beanstalk environment `tc-connect2sf-prod`

## Notes on Error Handling.  
`UnprocessableError` is thrown if operation cannot be completed.  
For example: duplicated project id added to the queue, Lead cannot be found etc.  
In such situation, the message from rabbitmq will be marked as ACK (removed).  
If we won't remove it from queue, the message will be stuck forever.
For any other type of error the message from the rabbitmq will me marked as ACK as well, however, it would requeued into another queue for later inspection. It right now publishes the message content to the same rabbitmq exchange (configured as mentioned in Configuration section) with routing key being `connect2sf.failed`. So, we have to map the exchange and routing key comibation to a queue to which no consumer is listeting e.g. `tc-connect2sf.failed` is used in dev environment. Now we can see messages, via rabbitmq manager UI, in this queue to check if any of the messages failed and what was id of the project which failed. We can either remove those messages from the queue, if we are going to add those leads manually in saleforce or move them again to the original queue after fixing the deployed environment.
